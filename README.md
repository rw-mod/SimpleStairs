# SimpleStairs (Fork)

This is a **fork** of the [original "SimpleStairs" mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2926310517) for RimWorld, updated to support **version 1.6**.

As of RimWorld 1.6, the **placingDraggableDimensions** XML element used in 1.5 is no longer supported. It has been superseded by **drawStyleCategory**, which should be used to specify the visual and interaction style of placeable objects.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Differences from the Original Mod

- **placingDraggableDimensions** has been replaced by **drawStyleCategory** to control object placement and visual behavior.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This is **not an official update** by the original author.
- This is a simple update for 1.6 compatibility.
- The mod should be safe to use in existing saves, but always back up your game just in case.
